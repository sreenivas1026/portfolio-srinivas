// GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

/**
 * Since the GitHub Pages is still failing to deploy, please follow these manual steps:
 * 
 * 1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/sreenivas1026/portfolio-srinivas
 * 2. Click on "Settings" tab
 * 3. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages"
 * 4. Under "Build and deployment" section:
 *    - For Source, select "Deploy from a branch"
 *    - For Branch, select "master" and "/root"
 *    - Click "Save"
 * 
 * 5. Wait a few minutes for the deployment to complete
 * 6. Refresh the page and you should see your site URL
 * 
 * Alternative approach:
 * If that doesn't work, try:
 *    - For Branch, select "gh-pages" and "/root"
 *    - Click "Save"
 * 
 * This will use the dedicated gh-pages branch we created, which has a simpler structure.
